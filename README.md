# VMem+ ‚Äî Virtual Memory Page Replacement Simulator

**VMem+** is a web-based simulator designed to demonstrate **page replacement algorithms** such as:

- **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out)  
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)  
- **Optimal**

It features **step-by-step simulation**, **memory frame visualization**, **real-time page fault tracking**, and **export options** for results in **CSV/PDF** formats.
