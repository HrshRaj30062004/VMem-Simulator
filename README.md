# VMem+ ‚Äî Virtual Memory Page Replacement Simulator

**VMem+** is a web-based simulator designed to demonstrate **page replacement algorithms** such as:

- **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out)  
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)  
- **Optimal**

It features **step-by-step simulation**, **memory frame visualization**, **real-time page fault tracking**, and **export options** for results in **CSV/PDF** formats.

## ‚ú® Features

- Simulates **FIFO**, **LRU**, and **Optimal** page replacement algorithms  
- Step-by-step **and** full-run simulation modes  
- Frame-by-frame memory visualization  
- **Live graph** tracking of page faults using Chart.js  
- Export simulation results to **CSV** and **PDF**  
- Clean, responsive **React.js** frontend

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### üñ•Ô∏è Backend (Node.js + Express)

```bash
cd backend  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```

> The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### üíª Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm start  
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure the **backend is running** before starting the frontend.
